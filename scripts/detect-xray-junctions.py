"""Reads the MARS 4.5 datapath images and records where a junction dot was painted.

The vertex graph says which wire carries a value next; it does not say whether
two wires that cross are joined.  The drawing answered that, with a dot
at every real junction and a bare crossing elsewhere, so the drawing is the
authority and this pulls the answer out of it.

Every place two wires could join -- a crossing, or one wire's end landing on
another -- is measured against the image.  A three-pixel wire leaves about a
line's worth of ink in a small window, a bare crossing about two lines' worth,
and a dot a good deal more, so the cases separate.

Run from the repository root, with a checkout of MARS 4.5 in BASE:
    python scripts/detect-xray-junctions.py
Needs pillow and numpy, which the app itself does not.
