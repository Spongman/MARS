/**
 * MIPS X-Ray: the animated datapath, ported from `thrax/tools/MipsXray.java`
 * and `thrax/tools/UnitAnimation.java`.
 *
 * One instruction's journey is a graph of wire segments over a drawing of the
 * datapath.  A segment grows a pixel at a time from `init` to `end` along one
 * axis; when it arrives, the segments it points at start growing in turn.  The
 * colour of every wire is chosen by the format of the instruction, so a load
 * and a branch light the same drawing up differently.
 *
 * The vertex graph is THRAX's own, generated into `datapaths.ts`; the engine
 * here reproduces its stepping and propagation.  The drawing is redrawn rather
 * than photographed: see `blocks.ts`.
