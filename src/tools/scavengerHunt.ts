/**
 * Scavenger Hunt: the MMIO multiplayer game. Up to 22 players share one MIPS
 * memory space, each polling their own 0x400-byte slot for move requests and
 * task work, gated by an administrator that authenticates whose turn is live.
 *
 * A memory-mapped treasure hunt.  Administrative registers, anyone may write the
 * first two, only the administrator (playerID === ADMINISTRATOR_ID) may flip
 * GAME_ON (:516, :541-560):
 *
 *   0xffffe000  authentication  one-time-pad value preceding a PLAYER_ID write (:47, :541-560)
 *   0xffffe004  player id       the currently "live" player, gated by authentication (:48, :541-560)
 *   0xffffe008  game on         administrator-only; (re)initializes the game (:49, :516-529)
 *   0xffffe00c  num turns       informational; anyone may write, no action taken (:50, :536-540)
 *
 * Per player, at `0xffff8000 + id * 0x400` (:57-70):
 *
 *   +0x00  where-am-i X   tool-owned; ignored on a player write (:112, falls to :712-719)
 *   +0x04  where-am-i Y   tool-owned; ignored on a player write
 *   +0x08  move-to X      player writes a destination, then...
 *   +0x0c  move-to Y      ...
 *   +0x10  move ready     ...a nonzero write here attempts the move (:562-655)
 *   +0x14  energy         read-only from the player's side; decremented per move, set by a task award
 *   +0x1c  player color    (:698-703)
 *   +0x124 task complete   a nonzero write checks the task array is sorted ascending (:658-694)
 *   +0x128 task array      20 words, mirrored as they are written
 *
 * PORT-SPECIFIC MIRRORING. MARS's `toolGetWord`/`toolReadPlayerData` peek live
 * MIPS memory on demand (:805, :849) whenever a rule needs another field -
 * for instance OFFSET_MOVE_TO_X/Y at the moment MOVE_READY is written. THRAX's
 * observer seam has no such live-peek API: a tool only ever learns of a write
 * at the moment it happens. So this port mirrors every field a rule depends
 * on (moveToX/Y, the task array, the authentication value) into its own state
 * as each write arrives, and consults the mirror instead of re-reading memory.
 * Behaviourally equivalent, given writes always precede the read that uses them
 * (matching this game's own protocol: write your destination, then MOVE_READY).
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL'S TWO UNFINISHED TODOs, IMPLEMENTED HERE.
 * The original's comment reads "TBD FUTURE --- need to keep track of
 * locations that the player has actually got to -- be able to tell that the
 * player has reached a certain location -- be able to tell that the player
 * has reached every location" - but the code immediately below it (:622-629)
 * already marks `hasVisitedLoc[i]` on an exact coordinate match, and "reached
 * every location" is already checked too, just not where that comment sits:
 * it happens lazily inside `ScavengerHuntDisplay.paintComponent` (:372-385),
 * a Swing repaint callback that runs on its own 100ms timer (:224), decoupled
 * from the MIPS program. That is a latent bug, not a missing feature: a
 * player's actual finishing moment is whatever repaint happens to run next,
 * so `finishTime` is not deterministic and can read low or late depending on
 * paint scheduling. This port fixes exactly that: `visited` and `finished`
 * are computed synchronously inside the move that causes them, addresses the
 * comment's own literal request "be able to tell", and `finishedAtInstruction`
 * (this port's clock, matching marsBot.ts's precedent of using instruction
 * count as a wall-clock stand-in) is captured at the instant of completion.
 *
 * The second TODO, at :709 ("Yet to be implemented: Enforce only one write of
 * MoveRequest per player per turn"), has no implementation anywhere in MARS -
 * a player whose ID is live can write MOVE_READY as many times as it likes
 * before the administrator authenticates the next turn. This port reads "per
 * turn" as "per span during which this player is the authenticated live
 * player": `movedThisTurn` is cleared whenever an authenticated PLAYER_ID
 * write makes a player live (whether or not the id actually changed - a
 * re-authentication is a new turn), and a further MOVE_READY write is ignored,
 * silently, the same way an out-of-bounds or too-far move already is.
 *
 * NOT REPRODUCED. The Swing GUI, its 100ms redraw timer, and the "Reset"
 * button (all cosmetic/host-specific); the illegal-write `JOptionPane` popup
 * (:735-738) is instead counted in `illegalWrites`, since a tool has no dialog
 * to raise and a silent drop would erase the one observable difference a
 * cheating write has from a legal one. Location and task-array randomisation
 * uses a small seeded PRNG local to this port, not `java.util.Random`, whose
 * bit sequence this does not reproduce - only determinism given a fixed seed
 * matters here, since placement and task numbers are not gameplay rules.
 *
 * H2b (onRewind) NOTE. Unlike T1's plain counters (order-independent, undone
 * by decrementing), this game's state is dominated by overwrite, not
 * accumulation: `playerId` is a last-write-wins identity switch, a player's
 * (x, y) is replaced outright by each successful move (not accumulated, so a
 * later distance check depends on knowing the immediately preceding position,
 * not just a running sum), `energy` is decremented per move but *overwritten*
 * flat to ENERGY_AWARD by a task completion (irreversible without the
 * pre-award value), and `visited`/`taskArray` are set-once/replaced-wholesale.
 * Only `authenticationValue` and the illegal-write counter are simple tallies.
 * That mix is the same shape T3 (MarsBot) concluded needs a checkpoint, not an
 * inverse: keep one snapshot of the whole accumulator state per
 * state-changing write (or per instruction), tagged by instruction count,
 * bounded like the machine's own backstepLimit; `onRewind(toInstructionCount)`
 * finds the last checkpoint at or before that count and restores it wholesale.
